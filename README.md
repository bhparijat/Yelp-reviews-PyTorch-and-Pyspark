## Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews

The Yelp dataset contains reviews of restaturants listed on the website. Each review is marked with a flag such as cool, funny, sad and given a rank on the scale of 5. I trained two models to predict whether each sentiment can be classified as positive or negative. The two models are:

**1. TF-IDF and Logistic Regression with PySpark**
**2. Word Embeddings neural network model implemented in PyTorch**
